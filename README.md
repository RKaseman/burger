Is it _as important_ to understand and work with existing code as it is to be able to write new code?

I asked myself this question when my front end development head struggled with this back end project. I want to understand everything, but realize it's not possible. What to do? Learn whatever I can, of course.

In light of the fact that my answer to the question posed is "yes", my goals on this project became:
  * record the process of refactoring code that works initially.
  * acknowledge that it's not refactoring, strictly speaking.
    * I do want to change some specific _behaviors_ without changing fundamental functionality, so
    * Refactor and repurpose.
  * comment the heck out of it to show I get it, even if I couldn't write it myself.
  * use even more in depth feedback from editor Visual Studio Code and Chrome Developer Tools to dive into them in greatest possible detail.
  * fight the feeling that this is cheating and _learn as much as I can in the process_.
  * finish with greater understanding and a working project.

## Here is: Cat Burgers (Don't take it wrong. I love cats.)

1. burgers_db -> burger_db (2 files)
1. schema.sql burger_db id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL -> id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, this fixed an undefined/blank error message I was getting on db creation
1. cats -> burgers (4 files) did plural before singular for easier edit selecting
1. cat -> burger (5 files) not cat-block.handlebars references or filename
1. Cat -> Burger (1 file)

1. sleepy -> devoured (4 files)
1. sleep -> devour (3 files)
1. input type="radio" -> [status 1], [status 2] (1 file)
1. cat_db TABLE burgers column sleepy -> devoured (HeidiSQL) not cat_db schema.sql or seeds.sql
1. schema.sql seeds.sql burger_db TABLE burgers column burger_name -> name (2 files) changed my original db instead of 14 results in 6 files
1. seeds.sql burger_db TABLE burgers VALUES removed explicit false
1. disabled cat_db, enabled burger_db
